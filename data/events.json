Whether by incompetence or design, Trump's attempt to coerce Iran was destined to fail, for reasons Thomas Schelling described decades ago.\n\nCoercion -- getting country to change its behavior, aka \"compellence\" -- is nearly impossible to achieve unless you articulate a clear set of demands. \"Do exactly this or we'll shoot.\" Trump's demands were never consistent. What, exactly, did Iran have to do to avoid attack? Every principal in his admin had a different answer. They still do. VP and cabinet officials still can't agree whether this was a regime change war or not. (It is).\n\nMoreover, amassing such a large \"armada\" to threaten Iran was counterproductive. Trump only paid attention to threats (\"or else\"), not assurances -- i.e. guarantees that if Iran complied, it would *avoid* the threatened U.S. punishment. \n\nWith Trump's many musings on regime change the last several weeks, Iran may have doubted that ANY concession would've been enough for Trump to back off. And they may have been right.\n\n3.) Trump owns this war. He owns it. Yes, Netanyahu has pushed Iran regime change for years, but unlike last summer's 12 Day War, this attack was not a case of alliance entrapment. Trump chose it willingly. He could have off-ramped the U.S. at any point in this standoff, which he himself engineered by assembling an \"armada\" to confront Iran. \n\nTrump's decision to pursue regime change in Iran is reckless and irresponsible. The American people did not want this war, which will only sap U.S. strength for unobtainable objectives (\"freedom\" in Iran) that aren't the U.S. business in the first place.\n\nThis action will cause severe blowback that will haunt the U.S. for generations. The U.S. had a chance to leave Middle East behind. But now Trump has put the U.S. front and center, once again, of the region's violence and dysfunction.    \n@defpriorities",

US Defense Intelligence Agency assessments (unchanged as of 2025-2026) project potential ICBM development no earlier than 2035.
