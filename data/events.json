Any escalation in the Persian Gulf has a direct impact on energy markets. The global economy, already shaken by recent years of pandemics, inflationary spirals, and wars on the periphery of Europe, is extremely sensitive to a new shock.\n\nIf energy prices rise sharply, European economies will come under new pressure. Asia will have to redirect supplies and bear higher costs. The United States will face a domestic inflationary wave that will have political consequences.\n\nBut the most dangerous scenario is a regional detonation.\n\nIf Lebanon becomes an active front, if Iraqi Shiite groups launch strikes against American bases, if Yemen escalates attacks on maritime traffic, the Middle East will find itself in a state of extended war. Israel would then be forced to allocate its military resources in several directions. The United States would have to increase its presence to ensure the security of its allies. Regional powers would be faced with a choice that could escalate into open confrontation.\n\nSuch a scenario would mean not a short military episode, but a prolonged confrontation with global consequences. There are times in the history of international relations when a local conflict escalates into a systemic crisis because the great powers fail to limit their own escalation.\n\nToday, we are at such a moment.\n\nThe United States faces a dilemma: if it withdraws, it will appear weak; if it engages deeply, it risks strategic exhaustion. Israel faces a choice: if it does not act decisively, it risks a future threat; if it acts excessively, it may open several fronts simultaneously. Iran faces a choice: if it responds with restraint, it will appear vulnerable; if it responds forcefully, it may provoke an uncontrollable escalation.\n\nWhen all sides find themselves in a situation of limited options, the risk of error increases exponentially.\n\nHere, war ceases to be an instrument of politics and begins to dictate politics. And when military logic replaces political logic, the international system enters a period of instability from which it is difficult to emerge without profound upheaval.\n\nToday's conflict is not simply a dispute over influence in the Middle East. It is a point of tension where military, economic, and civilizational factors meet simultaneously.\n\nAnd when such factors intersect, history rarely offers an easy way out.",

The United States will face a domestic inflationary wave that will have political consequences.\n\nBut the most dangerous scenario is a regional detonation.\n\nIf Lebanon becomes an active front, if Iraqi Shiite groups launch strikes against American bases, if Yemen escalates attacks on maritime traffic, the Middle East will find itself in a state of extended war. Israel would then be forced to allocate its military resources in several directions. The United States would have to increase its presence to ensure the security of its allies. Regional powers would be faced with a choice that could escalate into open confrontation.\n\nSuch a scenario would mean not a short military episode, but a prolonged confrontation with global consequences. There are times in the history of international relations when a local conflict escalates into a systemic crisis because the great powers fail to limit their own escalation.\n\nToday, we are at such a moment.\n\nThe United States faces a dilemma: if it withdraws, it will appear weak; if it engages deeply, it risks strategic exhaustion. Israel faces a choice: if it does not act decisively, it risks a future threat; if it acts excessively, it may open several fronts simultaneously. Iran faces a choice: if it responds with restraint, it will appear vulnerable; if it responds forcefully, it may provoke an uncontrollable escalation.\n\nWhen all sides find themselves in a situation of limited options, the risk of error increases exponentially.\n\nHere, war ceases to be an instrument of politics and begins to dictate politics. And when military logic replaces political logic, the international system enters a period of instability from which it is difficult to emerge without profound upheaval.\n\nToday's conflict is not simply a dispute over influence in the Middle East. It is a point of tension where military, economic, and civilizational factors meet simultaneously.\n\nAnd when such factors intersect, history rarely offers an easy way out.",
