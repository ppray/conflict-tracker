Many facilities such as the S-300 radar were destroyed, and the local Bavar-373 also failed, making it impossible to intercept Israeli fighter jets, resulting in Israel achieving absolute air superiority. Actual combat has proven that its level is far lower than the propaganda and far from reaching the standards of advanced countries.",
