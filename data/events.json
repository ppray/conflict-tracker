They report on March 5th and bring a flawless track record of beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe setup here is ideal. \n\nManagement is signaling that on Thursday's call they will raise 2026 guidance based on incoming DoD demand and their new Korean manufacturing pipeline.\n\nI believe there is strong potential for a gap up here if the market cooperates. \n\nListen to 6 min clip for details \n\n$AMPX $AVAV #Defense #Earnings #Drones",

          "desc": "$AMPX\n\nThe U.S. and Israel just initiated what looks to be a prolonged military engagement in Iran. \n\nI covered the earnings set-up for drone battery supplier $AMPX last night on my space. \n\n🔹 Best drone battery on market by 2X\n🔹 Works with every major supplier\n🔹 Growing +170% YOY\n\nHere is the breakdown heading into earnings March 5th. \n\nIf you are watching the defense sector, you already know loitering munitions and combat drones are going to be the tip of the spear for this entire operation.\n\n🔹The Iran Catalyst🔹\n\nAmprius is walking into next week fundamentally transformed. They are the confirmed power supplier for AeroVironment’s ( $AVAV) Switchblade 300, which just got a $200M military order. \n\nWith a conflict unfolding, emergency defense procurement for these systems will continue to surge. \n\nThe DoD requires NDAA-compliant, domestically sourced components, and Amprius already secured U.S. manufacturing with Nanotech Energy to meet that demand. \n\n🔹The Bear Thesis is Dead🔹\n\nThe biggest argument holding this stock at a discount was the fear of Chinese supply chain export controls cutting off their materials. \n\nManagement has fixed the issue. \n\nThey recently signed a Letter of Intent with Libest in South Korea for 1 million cells annually. The supply chain pivot is complete, and they are proving out an asset-light commercial scaling model that would allow them to quickly meet this moment. \n\n🔹The Earnings Setup🔹\n\nThe broader market took a liquidity hit on Friday, but $AMPX held its technical support line perfectly at $10.73. \n\nThe balance sheet is clean with ~$91M in cash and zero debt. They report on March 5th and bring a flawless track record of beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe setup here is ideal. \n\nManagement is signaling that on Thursday's call they will raise 2026 guidance based on incoming DoD demand and their new Korean manufacturing pipeline.\n\nI believe there is strong potential for a gap up here if the market cooperates. \n\nListen to 6 min clip for details \n\n$AMPX $AVAV #Defense #Earnings #Drones",
